            <h2>Introducing the isuzu d'max</h2>
            
            <p>The Isuzu D-Max is a pickup truck manufactured since 2002 by Isuzu Motors. It shares the same platform with several General Motors (GM) mid-size trucks in the United States such as the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon and Isuzu i-Series. The Chevrolet Colorado name is also applied to a rebadged version of the D-Max in the Middle East and Thailand, although not identical to the American version.</p>
            
            <ul>
            
                <li>
                    <span>In 2002, the D-Max</span> was prepared for a world premiere in Thailand. This location was chosen because GM-Isuzu had recently decided to close their small truck assembly plant in Japan and move their joint operation to Thailand. The D-Max is available in various models. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>The Spark</span> (single cab) (EX) is available only as a 4x2, with three configurations between cab chassis, long bed with power steering and without. SpaceCabs (extended cab), and Cab4s (double cab) can be divided into two major configurations: standard height 4x2s (SL, SX, SLX), and 4x4s (S and LS) with the "Rodeo" name instead of SpaceCab. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Crew cabs</span> are all sold with the same Cab4 name (Cab4 models became available late in last quarter). All are built and sold alongside the almost identical Chevrolet Colorado which had debuted in late first quarter of 2004.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Hi-Lander 3.0</span> (lifted 4x2), trim style became available in late 2003, and ground clearance equals that of the 4x4 models. There are only two cab styles to choose between. This makes Isuzu the third manufacturer in Thailand to begin selling lifted 4x2 pickups (after Toyota and Ford).
