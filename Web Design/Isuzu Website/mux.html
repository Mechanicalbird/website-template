            <h2>Introducing the isuzu d'max</h2>
            
            <p>In October 2004, Isuzu introduced the DDi iTEQ common-rail diesel engine family for the D-Max. The first engine to appear was the 3.0 4JJ1-TC 146 PS (107 kW; 144 hp), however since then, a design change in the front end of the car has forced engine alterations. Additionally, new MUA-5H five-speed manual transmission also introduced.</p>
            
            <ul>
            
                <li>
                    <span>During the first quarter</span> of 2005, a 2.5 4JK1-TC 116 PS (85 kW; 114 hp), the second DDi iTEQ engine, was introduced and offered as economical choice to replace its aging predecessor (4JA1-T was concurrently available for that year only). A mid-cycle refresh brought many models fitted with a new front bumper that incorporated an "instant spoiler" underneath, 4x4 models and Hi-Lander's suspensions were raised up 25 millimeters extra.
